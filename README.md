# Hello! I'm Sophie 👋

I'm a student studying computer science at university. I'm passionate about digital forensics, cryptography, secure software engineering, and the intersection of technology and society.

- 🔭 I’m currently making a website that track who edits Wikipedia pages on politically-contentious historical events and how
- 🌱 I’m currently learning digital forensics through [Weifeng Xu, Lin Deng, and Dianxiang Xu's Digital Forensics Lab](https://github.com/frankwxu/digital-forensics-lab)
